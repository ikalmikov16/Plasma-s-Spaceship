# Plasma's Spaceship

This project is a JavaScript game that runs in HTML Canvas.
In Adobe Photoshop, I created images of the spaceship and enemy characters.
I implemented a space moving animations with stars moving in the background.
The spaceship has three lives, and gets a temporary shield upon damage.
Only one laser shot can be displayed on the screen at a time. 
Score is incremented with each enemy killed.

## Controls
* Left Key - Move Left
* Right Key - Move Right
* Spacebar - Shoot
